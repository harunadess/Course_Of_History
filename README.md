Course of History
================================

Introduction
---------------------------------
The year is 2017. A PHD student is conducting research on time travel and quantum physics. 
While sitting up late one night he comes to the realisation that the field of science has slowed down, 
and great technological advances have been lacking. Looking back, he recalls that there were many Great Minds 
throughout history that were before their time. 

In order to bring these Great Minds into the 21st century, he invents a machine that can create a wormhole 
to bring back them back to be lecturers in his university! 
However, things do not go as planned. When the plane to the past is opened, it is hijacked by World Leaders!

Instead of just taking back Great Minds, Evil World Leaders are taken back with the intent of taking over
the modern world, and conscripting the bright, young youth of Queenâ€™s University Belfast.. 
Now a new crisis is affecting the world: Great Minds and World Leaders clash, in an event of epic scale. 
The future is uncertain, but it is sure to change the 
                Course of History!
